We have already submitted our pull request with net-next material for v6.17,
and therefore net-next is closed for new drivers, features, code refactoring
and optimizations. We are currently accepting bug fixes only.

Please repost when net-next reopens after Aug 11th.

RFC patches sent for review only are obviously welcome at any time.

See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/process/maintainer-netdev.html#development-cycle
